Welcome to my hobby project, Glutton Snake.

Glutton Snake is a snake game with a shitty UI, erroneous functionality and utterly embarrasing coding style.

Do play the game at your own risk. 

Controls:
    1. Arrow keys for moving your snake.
    2. ESC to end the game at any time should you feel bored, which you obviosly will!

Some bugs are present in the game at the time of this writing, but the next plans of this game is to 
introduce powerups, different difficulties of gameplay and many more features including a better UI.
